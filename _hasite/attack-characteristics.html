<ul>
<li><p>Non-state armed groups emerge as the predominant actors in security incidents</p></li>
<li><p>Unknown actors represent a significant portion of incidents, highlighting challenges in attribution</p></li>
<li><p>Criminal entities form a substantial category, suggesting that not all incidents are politically motivated</p></li>
<li><p>The diversity of actor types demonstrates the complex threat landscape faced by aid workers</p></li>

<p><br> <strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Different actor types show distinct patterns in their choice of attack methods</p></li>
<li><p>Certain attack methods are more commonly employed across multiple actor types</p></li>
<li><p>The width of flows indicates the severity (total affected) of different actor-method combinations</p></li>
<li><p>This relationship helps in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Predicting potential attack methods based on known actors in an area</p></li>
<li><p>Developing targeted security measures for specific threat actors</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding which combinations pose the greatest risk to aid workers</p></li>
