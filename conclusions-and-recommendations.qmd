## Key Findings

```{python}
# 1. Summary of Key Metrics Over Time
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
incidents = pd.read_csv('data/security_incidents.csv')
# Create yearly summary
yearly_summary = incidents.groupby('Year').agg({
    'Total affected': 'sum',
    'Total killed': 'sum',
    'Total wounded': 'sum',
    'Total kidnapped': 'sum',
    'Incident ID': 'count'  # Count of incidents
}).reset_index()

# Create subplot with dual y-axis
fig1 = make_subplots(specs=[[{"secondary_y": True}]])

# Add lines for casualties
fig1.add_trace(
    go.Scatter(x=yearly_summary['Year'], y=yearly_summary['Total killed'],
               name="Fatalities", line=dict(color='red')),
    secondary_y=False,
)
fig1.add_trace(
    go.Scatter(x=yearly_summary['Year'], y=yearly_summary['Total wounded'],
               name="Wounded", line=dict(color='orange')),
    secondary_y=False,
)
fig1.add_trace(
    go.Scatter(x=yearly_summary['Year'], y=yearly_summary['Total kidnapped'],
               name="Kidnapped", line=dict(color='blue')),
    secondary_y=False,
)

# Add bar for incident count
fig1.add_trace(
    go.Bar(x=yearly_summary['Year'], y=yearly_summary['Incident ID'],
           name="Number of Incidents", opacity=0.3),
    secondary_y=True,
)

# Update layout
fig1.update_layout(
    title="Trend Analysis: Incidents and Casualties (1997-2023)",
    plot_bgcolor='white',
    height=500,
    width=800,
    legend=dict(
        yanchor="top",
        y=0.99,
        xanchor="left",
        x=0.01
    ),
    hovermode='x unified'
)

# Update axes
fig1.update_xaxes(title_text="Year", showgrid=True, gridwidth=1, gridcolor='rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.2)')
fig1.update_yaxes(title_text="Number of Casualties", secondary_y=False, 
                  showgrid=True, gridwidth=1, gridcolor='rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.2)')
fig1.update_yaxes(title_text="Number of Incidents", secondary_y=True)

fig1.show()

### 1. Temporal and Geographic Patterns
- Security incidents show distinct temporal patterns with notable increases in specific regions
- Certain countries consistently experience higher incident rates
- Regional hotspots shift over time, suggesting evolving security challenges
- Seasonal variations in attack patterns have been identified

### 2. Attack Characteristics
- Non-state armed groups represent the primary threat actors
- Different actor types show distinct preferences in attack methods
- Attack contexts vary significantly by region and over time
- Certain attack types show higher lethality rates than others

### 3. Victim Demographics
- National staff face disproportionately higher risks compared to international personnel
- Gender distribution of victims varies by region and attack type
- Male aid workers constitute the majority of victims
- Improved reporting has reduced the proportion of unknown gender cases

### 4. Impact Analysis
- Total affected numbers show significant variation by:
  - Geographic location
  - Attack type
  - Actor type
  - Operational context

## Recommendations

```{python}

# 2. Impact Matrix
# Create summary by attack type and context
impact_matrix = incidents.groupby(['Means of attack', 'Attack context']).agg({
    'Total affected': 'sum',
    'Incident ID': 'count'
}).reset_index()

# Create heatmap
fig2 = px.density_heatmap(
    impact_matrix,
    x='Means of attack',
    y='Attack context',
    z='Total affected',
    title='Impact Matrix: Attack Types vs Contexts',
    labels={'Total affected': 'Total Affected'},
    color_continuous_scale='Reds'
)

# Update layout
fig2.update_layout(
    height=600,
    width=800,
    xaxis_title="Means of Attack",
    yaxis_title="Attack Context",
    xaxis={'tickangle': 45}
)

fig2.show()

### 1. Security Protocol Enhancement
- **Context-Specific Training:**
  - Develop targeted training programs based on regional threat patterns
  - Include scenario-based exercises reflecting common attack types
  - Provide gender-specific security awareness training

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Implement dynamic risk assessment tools
  - Regular updates based on emerging threat patterns
  - Include gender-sensitive risk analysis

### 2. Operational Adjustments
- **Staff Deployment:**
  - Consider seasonal risk patterns in deployment planning
  - Balance team composition based on context-specific risks
  - Enhance support systems for national staff

- **Resource Allocation:**
  - Prioritize high-risk areas for security investments
  - Allocate resources based on threat patterns
  - Invest in local security infrastructure

### 3. Prevention and Mitigation
- **Early Warning Systems:**
  - Develop indicators based on identified patterns
  - Implement real-time monitoring systems
  - Establish rapid response protocols

- **Partnership Development:**
  - Strengthen coordination with local security actors
  - Enhance information sharing among organizations
  - Develop community-based protection strategies

### 4. Data and Reporting
- **Incident Reporting:**
  - Standardize incident reporting procedures
  - Improve gender-disaggregated data collection
  - Enhance documentation of attack contexts

- **Analysis and Learning:**
  - Regular pattern analysis and trend identification
  - Systematic review of incident responses
  - Sharing of lessons learned across organizations

## Future Considerations

### 1. Emerging Threats
- Monitor evolving attack methods
- Track new actor types and motivations
- Assess impact of technological changes

### 2. Adaptive Response
- Regular update of security protocols
- Flexible response mechanisms
- Innovation in protection strategies

### 3. Capacity Building
- Enhance local security management capacity
- Develop specialized training programs
- Strengthen institutional memory

## Final Thoughts
The analysis reveals complex patterns in security incidents affecting humanitarian workers. Success in protecting aid workers requires:
- Continuous adaptation of security measures
- Enhanced understanding of local contexts
- Strong coordination among stakeholders
- Commitment to evidence-based approaches

These findings and recommendations aim to contribute to the ongoing effort to enhance the safety and security of humanitarian personnel worldwide.
